Attention:

- i) When loading the initial screen, there must be an animation in the View containing the user and password fields and the login and register buttons.

2) Colors and sizes must be in a separate file (eg colors.js and sizes.js)

3) Buttons and text inputs, etc. must be a stateless component (eg MyButton.js and MyTextInput.js)

4) The following contents must appear in the application:

- React Native Components 
- React Hooks (at least 4, among the options: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useMemo and useCallback)

Observations:

- I) The work is individual and it is not allowed to copy the work of a colleague. If this occurs, the grade will be divided by the total number of students involved in the copy.

- II) The Github link containing the work (or the compressed file) must be sent by the AVA by 11:00 pm on 10/23/22.

- III) Any questions/ problem, contact us by email.
